At some point a user will inevitably request a page that doesn't exist. To gracefully handle these routing errors and/or 404s, two templates can be utilised. The first is a ``404.liquid`` file in your ``pages`` directory. The second is a ``routing.liquid`` file in an errors directory, which you'll need to create.
