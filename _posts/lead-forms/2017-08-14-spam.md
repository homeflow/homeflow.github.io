To protect our forms from spam, we urge developers to use the [reCaptcha tool](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).

To implement a reCaptcha using Liquid, add this to your form:


    {{ "white" | recaptcha }}


This will produce a reCaptcha with a white background.

Alternate themes are available. See the 'themes' section
[here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/old/docs/customization) for a
selection of options that can be used.
