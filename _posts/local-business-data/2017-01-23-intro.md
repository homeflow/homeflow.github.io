This contains data on businesses in the area of a property. The information is collected by the local data company. In order to access it you need to call the liquid block in a similar fashion to geo features;

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  <div>
    {% local_business_data_block, max_distance : 50000, place_of_origin : property %}
      {% for local_business_datum in local_business_data %}
        {{local_business_datum.liquid_method}}
      {% endfor %}
    {%endlocal_business_data_block%}
  </div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The parameter "place_of_origin" is a required field and can be any of property, branch, site_content_chunk or location.

max_distance represents the maximum distance from the place of origin that the businesses can be, in metres. The default is 5000m.
