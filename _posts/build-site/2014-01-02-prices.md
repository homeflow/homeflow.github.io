Typically the default output for property prices is a good fit for most agents.

Some agents, especially those in London, may prefer to to list rental prices as per week.

There are two content blocks (found in agent admin at /configure/website/content/content/list), 'Lettings price text' and
'Sales price text' which allow the output of a `property.price` call to be changed on the fly.

The default output of a rental property will be in the form of '£1500pcm', to alter this we can insert some liquid into those content blocks.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
£{{property.price_value | pcm_to_pcw | number_with_delimiter}}pw | £{{ property.price_value| number_with_delimiter}}pcm
{%endraw%}

{%endhighlight%}

For rental properties ``property.price_value`` will always output a pcm price.

The filter ``pcm_to_pcw`` will perform a pcw conversion.

``number_with_delimeter`` will humanise the output, converting 1500 to 1,500.

Using a combination of these filters it should be possible to customise the pice output to the clients liking.
