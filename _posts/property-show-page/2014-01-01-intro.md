Many of the concepts we have used on the results partial, property small and elsewhere in the documentation get used on the property show page as well. The goal of the show page is to show all of the property's photos, videos, its full description, floor plans, brochures, Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and its location on a map (including a Street view), then channel all of this into a telephone or email lead to the agency.
