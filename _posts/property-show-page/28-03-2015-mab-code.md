Many agents like to use figures from the [http://www.mortgageadvicebureau.com/about-us](Mortgage Advice Bureau) alongside a small JS function within the Ctesius app that calulates a typical monthly repayment rate. It then sets the figures for each property result, or the single figure if on a property show page. Here's how one such theme does it.

In order for the function to work, you need to include the MAB function to your source:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% if current_channel.name == 'sales' %} 
 {% include 'includes/mab_code' %}
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, on the show page, you might have a side pod or text widget:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<span id="mortgageRepaymentQuote_{{property.property_id}}"></span>

<a title="Request Mortgage Quote" href="#" 
 onclick="window.open('http://www.mortgageadvicebureau.com/mab-calc/calculator.php?ID={{agency.mab_id}}&amp;amt={{property.price_value}}', 'MortgageCalculator', 'width=500,height=600')">
  Click for more.
</a>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The function will look for the ID as shown with the properties ID appended and fill in the value. A call to action can then be used. Note the ``{% raw %}{{agency.mab_id}}{% endraw %}`` field - you can add this in the backend preferences section, or statically add it.

The process is the same for the results page, though you would include the ID container within each property record.
