Printing using our core print page and stylesheet is simple to get going. Simply add a print anchor to your property show page and point its href to ``{{property | url_for_property}}/print``. If you need to modify the template, add a ``show_print.liquid`` (no preceeding underscore needed) in your properties directory, then ask a member of Homeflow to drop the template in. You can also create one from scratch if you'd rather.
