To get started, create a ``show.liquid`` file in your ``pages`` directory. A combination of the page and CMS drops are called to get attributes of a page, as such there's numerous fields you can output. See the [page drop](drops/#page-drop) for methods available.

Some very common outputs are as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
{{cms_page.title}}
{{cms_page.promo_content}}
{{cms_page.content}}
{{cms_page.category}}
{{cms_page.uri}}
{{cms_page.promo_asset | url_for_generic_image}}
{{cms_page.image | url_for_generic_image}}
{{cms_page.hero_asset | url_for_generic_image}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
