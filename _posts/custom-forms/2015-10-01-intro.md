Custom forms give the ability to create any form to be submitted to Homeflow. These are set up in your admin panel and can be used with the following snippet in liquid:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  <form action="/form_submissions" method="post">
    {% email_message_form, name : guaranteed_rent_form  %}

      <input type="hidden" name="f_id" value="{{html_form.id}}">
      <input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="/">

      {% for el in html_form.form_elements %}
        <label class="text" for="firstname">{{ el.element_label }}</label>
        {{ el.element_html }}
      {% endfor %}

    {% endemail_message_form %}

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Fields first_name, last_name and email are required fields on all custom forms.

Note that you will require the form ID to be passed and the redirect_url for the page on completion of the form submission.
