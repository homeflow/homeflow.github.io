Custom forms give the ability to create any form to be submitted to Homeflow. These are set up in your logos admin panel by clicking the "forms" sidebar item. More information on Logos [here](/admin-cms).

Here is an example of how a custom form can be rendered with liquid:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  <form action="/form_submissions" method="post">
    {% email_message_form, name : guaranteed_rent_form  %}

      <input type="hidden" name="f_id" value="{{html_form.id}}">
      <input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="/">

      {% for el in html_form.form_elements %}
        <label class="text" for="{{ el.element_for }}">{{ el.element_label }}</label>
        {{ el.element_html }}
      {% endfor %}

    {% endemail_message_form %}

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Fields first_name, last_name and email are required fields on all custom forms.

Note that you will require the form ID to be passed and the redirect_url for the page on completion of the form submission.

If you have no access to the liquid theme then you can include a custom form by first creating a theme content chunk with the form code as one would in the theme, then create a page in pages that calls the content chunk, like so,

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  {% content_block contact_us_form %}
    {% if content_block %}
      {{content_block}}
    {% endif %}
  {% endcontent_block %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

And viola, youâ€™ll have your custom form!
