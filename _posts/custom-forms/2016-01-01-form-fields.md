Once logged into Logos, navigate to "Forms" from the sidebar menu. You can now add new forms with the "new form" button or edit any existing forms that might already exist.

In the form edit page you will note the "form elements" tab. This is used to define all the form elements for a form. You can add as many form elements as you wish, and we cater for almost all combinations of elements. If you think we have missed any elements please drop us a line!

### Field options
Some form elements such as dropdown's can accept multiple values. You can define these with tab separation in the field options for that element. e.g. 'TV|Radio|Internet'
