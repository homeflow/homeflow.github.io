At Homeflow we like to keep our code base nice and clean and well organized, this is important when designing a theme to be used on the Homeflow platform.

You should aim to keep your files small and concise and to reuse code where possible by using partials, for example you may create a property partial which is reused in multiple areas throughout the site, not just the property pages.

You should also aim to keep your HTML and CSS code as clean as possible by removing unused or unnecessary code and formatting and indenting the files sensibly.

We would also advocate the use of code analysis tools like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/) or [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to identify and fix problems in your code.
