Content chunks are a very powerful tool and are used a lot in themes for all sorts of custom content. Due to the volume of these being used and the variants in each theme it is important to list them (and their description) all in the config.yml file inside the theme as shown in the section below. These will then be available in the agent backend:

``../configure/website/content/site_content_chunks``
