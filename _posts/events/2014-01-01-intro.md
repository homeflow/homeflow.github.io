Earlier in the documentation we talked about events - specifically the registering and 'kicking' of these events. This sections explores the events in more detail.

Events in Ctesius are small JavaScript callbacks which will be run a set times, or after certain page interactions.

Events are registered by calling ``Ctesius.registerEvent`` with the event name and a callback function, which can optionally take *n* arguments:

{% highlight javascript %}

Ctesius.registerEvent('EVENT_NAME', function(..ARGS..){
    ...
});

{% endhighlight %}

Events can also be triggered by 'kicking':

{% highlight javascript %}

Ctesius.kickEvent('EVENT_NAME', arg1, arg2, argn...);

{% endhighlight %}

####Toggles

If you opt into the toggle system (grid view, list view) the following events will be kicked when appropriate.

- ``before_properties_map_and_list_toggle_view_displayed``
- ``before_properties_map_toggle_view_displayed``
- ``before_properties_map_toggle_view_displayed``
- ``properties_grid_toggle_view_displayed``
- ``properties_map_and_list_toggle_view_displayed``
- ``properties_map_toggle_view_displayed``
- ``togglable_list_displayed``
- ``render_tab(tab_name)``
- ``no_root_view_displayed``

####Maps

The following events will trigger when there is an action on a map.

When various help texts are displayed on a drawable map the following actions may be kicked:

- ``deletebannertoggled``
- ``drawbannertoggled``
- ``editbannertoggled``
- ``deletebanner``
- ``deletebannertoggled``

When a map state has been changed and new properties should be fetched:

- ``before_draggable_map_updated`` - called before a Draggable (or drawn) map is updated with fresh properties called from the server. Useful for showing 'updating map' style page statuses.

- ``draggable_map_updated(properties)`` - called when results have been returned from a draggable map update. Returns the raw response from the server. The map has not yet been updated with new pins.

- ``map_marker_rendered(property)`` - called when a map marker has been rendered for the given property.

When interacting with a map:

- ``map_marker_opened(marker)`` - called when a map marker's popup section has been opened
- ``map_view_rendered`` - called whenever a map has been rendered.
- ``small_map_view_rendered``
- ``branch_map_view_rendered``
- ``page_reloading`` Some actions, like a redrawing of a polygon, may require a reloading of the page if a tab is switched. This event is kicked just before that happens, giving time for the page to show a 'loading' style alert.

####Saving Properties

The following events will be kicked when a saved property is added or removed. The `by_action` events signify that the user has saved a property where it was not previously saved - these events are useful for displaying a flash message or a subtle animation. Without the `by_action`, the event should be used to decorate saved properties or remove descorating. For instance, changing text from 'Save property' to 'Remove property':

- ``before_saved_property_removed_by_action(property)``
- ``before_saved_property_added_by_action(property)``
- ``saved_property_added(property)``
- ``saved_property_removed(property)``

The following methods will be called if a saved properties list is rendered:

- ``saved_properties_view_rendered``
- ``saved_property_view_rendered(property)``

####Saved Searches

Saved searches work in a similar way to saved properties:

 - ``saved_search_added``
 - ``saved_search_removed``

####Users

- ``before_create_new_user`` - called before validation on a user, when data is submitted using the action
- ``user_history_ready``
- ``user_history_search_added``
- ``user_log_in_failed``
- ``user_logged_in``
- ``user_logged_out``
- ``user_sign_up``
- ``user_sign_up_failed``
- ``before_user_log_in``
- ``before_user_sign_up``

####Views

When a JavaScript view is rendered, events are typically kicked before and after:

- ``disambiguation_rendered``
- ``before_most_recent_search_view_rendered``
- ``before_redirection_flash_ready`` - called before the system will display a flash notification (#/flash/some-notification)
- ``redirection_flash_ready``
- ``user_micro_view_rendered``
- ``user_profile_lightview_rendered``
- ``before_user_micro_view_rendered``
- ``before_user_profile_lightview_rendered``
- ``previous_property_rendered``
- ``next_property_rendered``
- ``most_recent_search_view_rendered``

####Misc

- ``before_search_form_submitted`` - called before validation search form data
