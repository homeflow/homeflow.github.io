The following events will trigger when there is an action on a map.

When various help texts are displayed on a drawable map the following actions may be kicked:

- ``deletebannertoggled``
- ``drawbannertoggled``
- ``editbannertoggled``
- ``deletebanner``
- ``deletebannertoggled``

When a map state has been changed and new properties should be fetched:

- ``before_draggable_map_updated``

Called before a Draggable (or drawn) map is updated with fresh properties called from the server. Useful for showing 'updating map' style page statuses.

- ``draggable_map_updated(properties)`` 

Called when results have been returned from a draggable map update. Returns the raw response from the server. The map has not yet been updated with new pins.

- ``map_marker_rendered(property)``

Called when a map marker has been rendered for the given property.

When interacting with a map:

- ``map_marker_opened(marker)``

Called when a map marker's popup section has been opened.

- ``map_view_rendered``

Called whenever a map has been rendered.

- ``small_map_view_rendered``
- ``branch_map_view_rendered``
- ``page_reloading`` 

Some actions, like a redrawing of a polygon, may require a reloading of the page if a tab is switched. This event is kicked just before that happens, giving time for the page to show a 'loading' style alert.
