CMS pages and other flavours of CMS content continue to grow in complexity. This has been driven by a wide range of requirements from both agents and end users. In order to overcome this problem, we have come up with the concept of nodes. 

A node is a generic object (usually a page) that can be attached to multiple CMS data objects. For this example, we will be thinking of a Node as a Location Guide. We can then attach any data object within Homeflow such as a Branch or a Property to a node. These are known as the node items. This gives the node great power as they have access to a wide range of data within the system. For Location Guides, a large amount of rich CMS data you can be rendered on a Location Guide page.
