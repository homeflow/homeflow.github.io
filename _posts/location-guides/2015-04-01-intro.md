Location guides provide collective information about locations and areas. This information can be in the form of local branches, geographical location information, location specific content etc. Location guides are nodes with a node_type of LocationGuide. 

What is a node? At Homeflow we have a growing complexity of CMS pages and other flavours of CMS content which is brought on by a wide range of requirements from lots of agents and end users. In order to overcome this problem we have come up with the concept of using nodes. 

A node is a generic object (usually a page) that can be attached to multiple CMS data objects. For this example we will be thinking of a Node as a LocationGuide (mentioned above). We can then attach any data object within Homeflow such as a Branch or a Property to a node (given the availability in Logos to set these). These are known as the node items. This gives the node great power in being able to access a wide range of data within the system and in the example of LocationGuide’s, lots of rich CMS data that you can render on the LocationGuide page. 

###Logos

To set up a new Node log in to your logos admin panel using your agency login details at:

:agency_name.content.homeflow.co.uk

You can now see ‘Nodes’ in the navigation menu. In this section you can add nodes with the ‘New node’ button. 

You will need to add a title and a slug for the node (this is the URL path). Currently we only support LocationGuide’s as node types. 

Once you have created your node you can start adding node items. Click the ‘Node items’ tab and select a type to add your first node item. 

You will need to add a node item name and make the appropriate selection for the node item. For example if you chose content chunk they you will need to pick a content chunk, or if you chose an input such as property or branch then you will need to start entering the name for the dropdown to appear for selection.

Node pages (Location Guide show)

Node items for a page node are flexible and powerful and you can use them anywhere on the page. Below are some examples of how you can use these:

Node items are returned in blocks. You can pull all node items for a page by calling the block

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="node">
	{% with_node hf_node %}
	  {% for node_item in node_items %}
	  	<div class="node_item">
	    	{{node_item.content}}
	    </div>
	  {% endfor %}
	{% endwith_node %}
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

However this is not that powerful given that you will probably have node items with different methods and therefore they will not all contain the ‘content’ method. Also you will want to chose different node items for placement round the page. 

You can filter the node items by type as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="node">
	<h3>Branch node item</h3>
	{% with_node hf_node, type: branch %}
	  {% for node_item in node_items %}
	  	<div class="node_item">
	    	Branch name is: {{node_item.name}}
    		Branch info is: {{node_item.description}}
	    </div>
	  {% endfor %}
	{% endwith_node %}
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This will return all the node items that have a branch type on the page. Within this the branch object will be available so you can use all the branch methods such as branch.name, branch.email etc. 

You can filter node items by name.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
	<div class="node">
		{% with_node hf_node, name: my_great_node_item   %}
		...
	</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also combine filters.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
	<div class="node">
		{% with_node hf_node,  type: sitecontentchunk, name: my_great_node_item   %}
		...
	</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
	<div class="node">
		{% with_node hf_node, type: sitecontentchunk, name: location_pod  %}
		  {% for node_item in node_items %}
		    {{node_item.description}}
		  {% endfor %}
		{% endwith_node %}
	</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

###Location page

In this example we can search the nodes for the location page and return all the node items for that node. So this means for a location page we can return content such as local branch information, content_chunks and more for the area guide. 

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
	{% assign hf_node = ‘slug-name’ | location_node_by_slug %}
	<h2>Found node from location then link to branch</h2>
	<div class="node">
	{% with_node hf_node,  type: branch  %}
	  {% for node_item in node_items %}
	    Branch name is: {{node_item.name}}</br>
		...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
