Location guides provide collective information about locations and areas. This information can be in the form of local branches, geographical location information, location specific content etc. Location guides are nodes with a node_type of LocationGuide. 

###What is a node? 

CMS pages and other flavours of CMS content continue to grow in complexity. This has been driven by a wide range of requirements from both agents and end users. In order to overcome this problem, we have come up with the concept of nodes. 

A node is a generic object (usually a page) that can be attached to multiple CMS data objects. For this example, we will be thinking of a Node as a Location Guide. We can then attach any data object within Homeflow such as a Branch or a Property to a node. These are known as the node items. This gives the node great power as they have access to a wide range of data within the system. For Location Guides, a large amount of rich CMS data you can be rendered on a Location Guide page.
