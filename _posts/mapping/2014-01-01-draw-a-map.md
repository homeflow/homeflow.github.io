Draw a Map is an extension of the Leaflet mapping system that the Homeflow platform uses to provide freehand polygon drawing to property maps on the website.

To get up and running, add: ``Ctesius.addConfig('draw_a_map', true)`` to ``_js_events_registers.liquid``.

In principle, Draw a Map works straight out of the box and will immediately appear on any property maps on the client website, held within its own independent toolbar. However, depending on the map container and the div hierarchy, it is quite possible that some custom CSS will have to be implemented.

The DaM style library is included in the application CSS, however, some themes do not use this CSS file. If this is the case with the theme you are building, please use the [DaM base styles](/appendix/#dam-styles) in the appendix.

A number of events are associated with different DaM states so you can provide feedback to the user. See the [DaM events section](/events/#maps) for more.
