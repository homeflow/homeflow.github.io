Drops are an important concept in terms of the Ctesius app and most methods you use will come from one of the drops. Each property record, for example, will call the ``PropertyDrop`` class and thus methods such as ``property.price`` are made available for each property.

**NOTE:** You should always check that a variable exists before you try to use it, to avoid errors when the value is nil.
e.g.
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
{% if property.video_url %}
  {% property.video_url | split: '/' %}
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
