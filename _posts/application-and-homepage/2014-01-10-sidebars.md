The Ctesius app can render sidebars automatically once set up. To get up and running with this, you simply add the following line to your ``application.liquid``:

``{% raw %}{{page.sidebar}}{% endraw %}``

The next step is to create the sidebar. To do this, create yourself a ``sidebars`` folder under your theme's directory. Sidebars should follow a consistent naming pattern. Here's some examples:

- ``_branch_show_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_branches_index_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_home_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_locations_show_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_pages_show_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_property_show_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_property_results_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_articles_show_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_valuation_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_staff_show_sidebar.liquid``
- ``_users_new_sidebar.liquid``

Next you need to open your theme's ``config.yml`` and add a ``sidebars`` section. You then quote the controller and action for the page in question. For example, the controller for a CMS page that lived under your ``pages`` directory would be ``pages``, the action would be ``show``. The controller for a properties index page would be ``properties``, the action ``index``, and so on:

{% highlight yaml %}
sidebars:
	'pages#show' : 'pages_show_sidebar'
{% endhighlight %}

Once you've added these prerequisites, your HTML and content into the sidebar, it should render it on the targeted page. As always when using the YAML file, use consistent spaces for indenting to make sure it doesn't error out.
