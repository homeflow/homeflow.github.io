Homeflow has an online instant valuation tool which is automatically embedded in all themes as it is embedded into the core Ctesius code. Homeflow control whether an Agency has this tool enabled. For more information please contact Homeflow Support.

The valuation tool is contained within a modal popup which can be called by passing #valuation into any URL on the site. e.g:

```http://www.dbroberts.co.uk/pages/selling#valuation```
