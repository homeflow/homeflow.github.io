Node items for a page node are flexible and powerful and you can use them anywhere on the page. Node items are returned in an array like structure from the node drop and so can be searched and filtered using standard liquid filters.

For example, here we get out all node items with the name of 'region_page_text'

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
    {% assign node_items = node.node_items | selected_by :  'name' , 'region_page_text' %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Each node item has the following fields:

  - name, the name as given for this node item in the CMS
  - type, the type of node object
  - object, the actual node object - could be a Branch, a Location, and Image


And here we get all nodes of type 'Branch', transform each node_item into it's object with 'map' and then sort that list by the branches name.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  {% assign branch_nodes = node.node_items | selected_by :  'type' , 'Branch' | map : 'object' | sort_by: 'name' %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
