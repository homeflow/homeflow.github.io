You can access the nodes bound to agencies, branches or locations by using the selected_by helper.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
    {% assign hf_nodes = agency.nodes | selected_by :  'slug' , 'my_cool_node_slug' %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This will return an array of nodes with the slug 'my_cool_node_slug'.

You can also select these by their node_type (as set in the backend) like so:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
    {% assign agency_nodes = agency.nodes | selected_by: "node_type", "auction"  %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can then iterate through this array and access the node and its associated node items.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  {% for hf_node in hf_nodes %}
  ...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

* Please note, it is important to assign hf_node as the loop variable as the underlying code searches for this variable when accessing the node data.

Node items for a node are flexible and powerful and you can use them anywhere on the page. Node items are returned in an array like structure from the node drop and so can be searched and filtered using standard liquid filters.

For example, here we get out all node items with the name of 'region_page_text'

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
    {% with_node hf_node, name: region_page_text %}
      {% for node_item in node_items %}
        ...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Each node item has the following fields:

  - name, the name as given for this node item in the CMS
  - type, the type of node object
  - object, the actual node object - could be a Branch, a Location, and Image


And here we get all nodes of type 'Branch'.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
  {% with_node hf_node, type: Branch %}
    {% for node_item in node_items %}
    ...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
