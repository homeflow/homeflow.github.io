To set up a new node, log in to your logos admin panel using your agency login details at:

:agency_name.content.homeflow.co.uk

You can now see ‘Nodes’ in the navigation menu. In this section you can add nodes with the ‘New node’ button. You will need to add a title and a slug for the node (this is the URL path). Currently we only support LocationGuide’s as node types.

Once you have created your node you can start adding node items. Click the ‘Node items’ tab and select a type to add your first node item.

You will need to add a node item name and make the appropriate selection for the node item. For example if you chose content chunk, then you will need to pick a content chunk, or if you chose an input such as property or branch, then you will need to start entering the name for the dropdown to appear for selection.
